                        I'm a third year student at the University of Twente studying Creative Technology. 
                        I'm an aspiring Full Stack Developer, that is currently learning more and more about the field through The Odin Project. 
                        I'm eager to learn more about it and I seek to combine that knowledge and skills, with another passion of mine, that being the field of audio. 
                    </div>

                    <div class='paragraph'>
                        I have been passionate about sound design, music production and audio-visuals for as long as I can remember.
                        However it is no secret that this is an expensive hobby to have, so I have been more and more interested by the idea of working
                        on projects that allow to mess around with making music, samples, audio-reactive visuals, all from with-in their browser.

                        is a free online course that dives into the field of Full Stack Development. It is split into two parts: the <em>Foundations</em> and the <em>Learning Path</em>
                        , which also splits into two. You can either dive deeper into <i>JavaScript</i> or start learning about <i>Ruby on Rails</i>.
                    </div>

                    <div class='paragraph'>
                        In my opinion the main selling point of the course are the <em>mini-projects</em> that you are tasked with. 
                        Different mini-projects focus on different topics of web development. Additionally, The Odin Project and its community emphasize
                        learning the concepts, rather than having a beautifully done project. Professional looking projects are going to come later!

                        To the right you can see live previews of these mini-projects that I have completed so far.

                        My longest lasting passion/hobby is for sure working with audio. It all started with me making beats back in tenth grade.
                        It then progressed to me learning about drum sound design, after that I started learning about melodic sound design.

                    <div class='paragraph'>
                        During my studies, the project that highlighted my skills with working with with audio was during our Module 5 project.
                        This quarter focuses on game development, and during it I got to showcase my sound design skills.

                        On the right, I included two links. The top one is a WebGL build of the actual game that we made during M5.
                        Below that, there is the Notion portfolio dedicated to the same project, more specifically, the part that I worked on.
