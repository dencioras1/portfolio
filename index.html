                        I'm a third year student at the University of Twente studying Creative Technology. 
                        I'm an aspiring Full Stack Developer, that is currently learning more and more about the field through The Odin Project. 
                        I'm eager to learn more about it and I seek to combine that knowledge and skills, with another passion of mine, that being the field of audio.

                    <div class='paragraph'>
                        I have been passionate about sound design, music production and audio-visuals for as long as I can remember.
                        However it is no secret that this is an expensive hobby to have, so I have been more and more interested by the idea of working
                        on projects that allow to mess around with making music, samples, audio-reactive visuals, all from with-in their browser.

                        is a free online course that dives into the field of Full Stack Development. It is split into two parts: the <em>Foundations</em> and the <em>Learning Path</em>
                        , which also splits into two. You can either dive deeper into <i>JavaScript</i> or start learning about <i>Ruby on Rails</i>.
                    </div>

                    <div class='paragraph'>
                        In my opinion the main selling point of the course are the <em>mini-projects</em> that you are tasked with. 
                        Different mini-projects focus on different topics of web development. Additionally, The Odin Project and its community emphasise
                        learning the concepts, rather than having a beautifully done project. Professional looking projects are going to come later!

                        To the right you can see live previews of these mini-projects that I have completed so far.
